        The existence of Kampung Dago Pojok in Dago Village, Coblong Subdistrict cannot be separated from the figure of
        a local artist named Rahmat Jabaril. Rahmat is a young man who has a high sense of appreciation for art. Several
        years ago, he was concerned that he saw the village where he lived less developed.

        Starting from this, plus his love of art, Rahmat then tried to innovate by beautifying the walls and streets of
        the village. The various murals, pictures and paintings he created. As a result, Dago Pojok began to be famous
        as an art village and attracted tourists to come.
